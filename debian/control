Description: module to create simple lightweight record-like structures
 Struct::Dumb creates record-like structure types, similar to the struct
 keyword in C, C++ or C#, or Record in Pascal. An invocation of this module
 will create a construction function which returns new object references with
 the given field values. These references all respond to lvalue methods that
 access or modify the values stored.
 .
 It's specifically and intentionally not meant to be an object class. You
 cannot subclass it. You cannot provide additional methods. You cannot apply
 roles or mixins or metaclasses or traits or antlers or whatever else is in
 fashion this week.
 .
 On the other hand, it is tiny, creates cheap lightweight array-backed
 structures, uses nothing outside of core. It's intended simply to be a
 slightly nicer way to store data structures, where otherwise you might be
 tempted to abuse a hash, complete with the risk of typoing key names. The
 constructor will croak if passed the wrong number of arguments, as will
 attempts to refer to fields that don't exist.
